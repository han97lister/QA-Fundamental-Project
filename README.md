### **Brief**
For this project, I had the objective of creating a web application that can create, read, update and delete (CRUD) as well as implement other methodologies learnt throughout the training. Some of these include a Trello Board, a relation database, clear design phases illustrating the architecture and a CI Pipeline.

### **My Approach**
I decided to base my application on recipes as cooking is a big hobby of mine. I envisioned an application that allows users to read recipes posted by others, as well as upload their own. In order to achieve this, users could do the following:

* Create an ingredients list that stores just the name.
* Create a method that stores the steps to a recipe, as well as the expected time duration.
* Create a recipe that stores:
  * The name of the recipe
  * The essential ingredients provided by the ingredients list
  * The relevant quantity for each ingredient
  * The relevant method for the recipe - provided by the method database
* View recipes posted
* Update or Delete recipes

### **Architecture** 

#### **Database Structure**
My final entity relationship diagram (ERD) illustrates the tables within my application and their many-to-many relationships:

#### **CI Pipeline**
The CI Pipeline for my application:

### **Project Tracking**
I chose to track my project using Trello and have attached a snapshot below.

I seperated my Trello board into five sections to clearly track my progress and I did this by having a to-do, doing and done section as well as a user story section in order to always have a clear vision of my application and finally a product backlog which contained the brief.

### **Risk Assessment**
